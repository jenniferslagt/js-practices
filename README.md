# js-practices
Doing some js projects, just to refresh my skills after traveling the world for a couple of months.

## Description
In this repo you can view some small JS projects. The goal is to sharpen my skills. Even though the main focus is on JavaScript, I think it's great to take a look at my SASS code as well!
